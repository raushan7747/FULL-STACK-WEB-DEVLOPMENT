# EXPRESS complete
<hr>
<p>Express is a framework to build an API. Express helps us to receive requests from the end-user and to send the response corresponding to the requests.</p>

#### Let we take an example of social media:
A social media home tab: <a>https://www.instagram.com</a>

When we search(or make an API request) for any specific account like `user01110` then we get some results(API response) related to this query then the address looks like this: <a>https://www.instagram.com/user01110</a>

### Response as requested can we build efficiently without needed hard-coding using an Express framework


## To download the package follow the command given below:
```cmd
npm i express
```
